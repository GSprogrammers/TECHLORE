            <p>What a huge experience. From my experience as a Game player and a Programmer. this is a technology that wants to combine many ICT fields. (3D modelling & designing | graphic designing | programming ,etc…) only those are the things we want
                to make a successful game! we want socialized people because without that we can gameplayer the same without those! for a game players, want to know about what are the specifications that we want to play each game! Playing games not only
                has disadvantages!...</p>

                ether. They reproduce among themselves and produce new offspring, which have different attributes and valuations compared to their parents. Within a few short weeks of their launch, cryptokitties racked up a fan base that spent $20 million
                worth of ether to purchase, feed, and nurture them. Some enthusiasts even spent upward of $100,000 on the effort...</p>
