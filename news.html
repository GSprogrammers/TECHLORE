        <h2>EV onboard charger development with the latest SiC Technology</h2>
        <p>Global Electric Vehicle (EV) usage is expected to dramatically increase over the next few years, with projections of new EV car sales growing from approximately 1 million in 2020 to around 50 million by the year 2030. The onboard charger (OBC)
            within the EV plays the crucial role of converting input AC voltage that comes from the grid to a DC voltage that charges the battery within the vehicle. In this article, we will summarize a presentation by Kevin Lenz, Marketing Manager at
            Rohm Semiconductor on their silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFET devices, and the advantages for their use in the OBC power conversion application. This talk was delivered at the recently concluded Electronica 2022 Power Forum....

        <h2>Low-RDS(on) SiC FETs for Improved Power Converter Performance</h2>
        <p>Silicon carbide power devices provide several advantages over their silicon counterparts in power-conversion efficiency, improved high-temperature performance, and use of simpler circuit topologies. In some key application areas in high demand,
            such as electric-vehicle traction inverters, DC/DC converters, and on-board chargers (OBCs), the device-specific on-state resistance (RDS(on) × A, where A is the conduction area) is a key figure of merit (FOM) that affects device capacitance
            and hence efficiency in both hard-switching (HS) and soft-switching (SS) topologies. As fast-charging standards for EVs migrate toward higher voltages and higher power, a number of devices may be needed to be paralleled to, which can lead
            to system-level challenges in managing devices that may not be well matched in terms of their performance over time and temperature. Hence, lower-RDS(on) devices in low-thermal–resistance packages offer advantages in these high-power applications....</p>
